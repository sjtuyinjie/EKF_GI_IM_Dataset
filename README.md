# EKF_GI_IM_Dataset
A GNSS-IMU benchmark Dataset for tightly coupled GNSS/INS integration

Project Authors: Haitao Jiang, Jie Yin

This  dataset has following features:

The raw GNSS data were acquired using a u-blox F9P board operating at a sampling rate of 10 Hz, while the raw IMU data was obtained through the MYNTEYE-s1030 module. The reference trajectory was computed using the post-processing kinematic mode of NovAtel Inertial Explorer software, utilizing the tactical-grade GNSS/INS POS320 system.

Please give us a star if this project is helpful to your research. Thank you!
